# Rust / Informix Big Updates

I need to update one field in 110,000 records, but each update needs to run independently with logging. I want a cli to gather the keys and the field that will need updated, set up the queries to be run, run the queries individually, and show progress throughout



## Easy AI Chats

The toughest part of development with AI so far, is including the plan, background, and files in each chat.  Using a project and project files is possible, but keeping the files current is a real pain.
 

I'm going to try doing this in the Readme, with a script to gather all updated files into one folder that I can quickly attach to a chat.


For a bigger project - I might try setting up a project with docs to contain the background, the plan, and the status or what steps remain, and a script to gather all updated files into one folder that I can quickly attach to a chat.

## AI-Assisted Development Process

This project was created with AI assistance through multiple conversation sessions:

1. [Set up GitHub Repo for Rust CLI Documentation](https://claude.ai/share/48ade5b9-4cea-44af-8802-5c6910ab356e)


After reading this chat, I decided that the separate docs were unwarranted for this size of project We'll switch to maintaining project status and all in the Readme

2. [Rust CLI for Informix ODBC Database Management](https://claude.ai/share/7cf3310d-84ff-4d7c-8dad-550e7f829e3a)
