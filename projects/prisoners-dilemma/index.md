## AI-Assisted Development Process

This project was created with AI assistance through multiple conversation sessions:

### prompt

Let's build an app to play prisoner's dilemma with friends.  I want to go through the entire process of developing the app with best practices in software development, keep your responses to small, manageable bits with descriptions of where we've been, what we focused on, and options for next steps.

This next bit was a frustrating run trying to fix github page build, a great example of a couple things
- frustrating ai looping back into the repeated suggestions
    - another way to look at this is proof of my learning even with AI doing a lot of work for me
- step away for a moment - come back and try from a different angle
