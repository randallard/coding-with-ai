## AI-Assisted Development Process

This project was created with AI assistance through multiple conversation sessions:

### prompt

Let's build an app to play prisoner's dilemma with friends.  I want to go through the entire process of developing the app with best practices in software development, keep your responses to small, manageable bits with descriptions of where we've been, what we focused on, and options for next steps.

Not sure I like the prompt I'm using but... too lazy to change it

This next bit was a frustrating run trying to fix github page build, a great example of a couple things
- frustrating ai looping back into the repeated suggestions
    - another way to look at this is proof of my learning even with AI doing a lot of work for me
- step away for a moment - come back and try from a different angle
- final solution was to ask claude to search online for a solution
    - had to ask twice to get the most effective solution

I did scrub the main instruction and just have them blank now - that last chat was super annoying and had been getting "let's ignore your question about this error and focus on development"

26. [Troubleshooting npm script error in Prisoner's Dilemma app](https://claude.ai/share/2a9a7e89-7525-404a-a2d5-e6bafef72f76)

Another key takeaway that comes to mind now is that I'm definitely not using all of what they suggest.  Especially at the end of a chat, I'm usually picking and choosing or moving on to the next chat with a refined approach.
