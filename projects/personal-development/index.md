# Personal Development

I don't think I'll need a repo for this - will see how it goes with just Claude Project 

## Initial prompt

I've got a bunch of stuff I want to work on - help me keep track and stay motivated, I'll take notes throughout the day and sign off at night with an idea of what I want to work on the next morning - here are the things I want to keep track of:


 I've got a good start on the YouTube channel docs and need to set up the repo for them


Also want to keep up the momentum on the prisoner's dilemma project


And keep the coding-with-ai docs up to date the the new youtube channel chats

## Easy AI Chats

This is a different type of project so we'll see what kinds of issues pop up 

## AI-Assisted Development Process

This project was created with AI assistance through multiple conversation sessions:
